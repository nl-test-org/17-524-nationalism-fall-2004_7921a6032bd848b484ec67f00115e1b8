Second, nationalist narratives are often communicated in ways to create and/or entrench nationalist sentiment. Means of modern communication, e.g. printing presses, radio, television as well as public educational institutions create and spread national narratives. How do such technologies and public institutions do what they purportedly do? What is the role of intellectuals? Do they (meaning intellectuals) impose the national narrative on the masses or do the masses create and act upon their own? |
